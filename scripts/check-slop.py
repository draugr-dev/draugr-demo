"""Fail on the throat-clearing openers that announce a point instead of making it.

Both are the same habit: chopping one connected thought into separate short sentences. It is the
most recognizable tell in generated prose, and it is the one that keeps reaching our published
pages because each fragment reads fine on its own.

    binary contrast   "This is not a scanner malfunctioning. It is the base image."
                      -> "This is the base image, not a scanner malfunctioning."

Also the em dash, which is the other half of the same fingerprint. It reads as considered and is
almost never the punctuation a person reaches for: nearly every one marks a clause that would be
clearer joined with a conjunction, or ended and started again. Ninety-five of them sat across the
two files behind the in-product help before anybody counted, and the reason they survived is that
each one looks deliberate on its own line.

Deliberately narrow otherwise. Adverbs, business jargon and listicle transitions are all in the
same family and none of them is gated, because judging them needs a reader: `actually` is noise in
a blog lead and load-bearing in a reference page, and a check that cannot tell the difference
teaches people to add a skip rather than a fix. Those stay a review job -- see the `no-ai-slop`
skill, which is the standard this file gates the checkable part of.

Prose only: code fences, front matter, tables, headings and link text are skipped.
